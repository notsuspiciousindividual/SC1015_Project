Which future movie will be best picture
Main aim: Is to understand what factors help a movie to win best picture
What type of machine learning model should we use to predict the next picture winning
Conclude with video and findings


EDA Part:
Remove Movies released 2023 >
Remove movies without runtime
Remove movies without release date
Bring genre's 
Put Column with "Best Winning"

Training,Test:
Decision Tree Algorithm
Compare with other algorithm (KNN Model)
Take account how many null data we have

Correlation between the whatever to bestPicture

- What percentage of budget is the revenue



revenue / budget * 100 = percentageOverall (to regulate the inflation)

See which one has higher correlation so that we understand which properties 
help win an oscar (heatmap)

Dataset (uncleaned)
-> Cleaning
-> EDA to clean more
-> visualize using graphs
-> sampling + balancing 
decide which variables to use (avoid over-fitting)
-> Machine learning, what classification (Decision Tree & KNN Model)
-> additional machine learning to find which model is best for our oscard award learning
-> video to summarise our learning and project

idk testing pls ignore
